### PARSER


  ## About :

    A Java CLI tool that parses web server access log file, loads the log to MySQL 
    and checks if a given IP makes more than a certain number of requests for the given duration
    Please ensure MySQL is up and all Schema created before running. 

  ## How it works :
    
    The tool takes "startDate", "duration" and "threshold" as command line arguments. 
    "startDate" is of "yyyy-MM-dd.HH:mm:ss" format, "duration" can take only "hourly", "daily" as inputs 
    and "threshold" can be an integer.
    
    For instance :
      
      java -jar "parser.jar" --accesslog=<PATH_TO_FILE> --startDate=2017-01-01.13:00:00 --duration=hourly --threshold=100
      
      The tool will find any IPs that made more than 100 requests starting from 2017-01-01.13:00:00 
      to 2017-01-01.14:00:00 (one hour) and print them to console AND also load them to another 
      MySQL table with comments on why it's blocked.
      
      java -jar "parser.jar" --accesslog=<PATH_TO_FILE> --startDate=2017-01-01.13:00:00 --duration=daily --threshold=250
      
      The tool will find any IPs that made more than 250 requests starting from 2017-01-01.13:00:00 
      to 2017-01-02.13:00:00 (24 hours) and print them to console 
      AND also load them to another MySQL table with comments on why it's blocked.
    
  ## Log file
